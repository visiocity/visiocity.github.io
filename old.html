      <h2 class="page-header">Overview</h2>
      <p>We introduce VISIOCITY, a new challenging benchmark dataset
      for video summarization. VISIOCITY stands for Video Summarization based on Continuity, Intent and Diversity. VISIOCITY is a large challenging dataset, which is an order of magnitude larger (both in terms of total number of hours as well as
      the duration of each video) compared to existing datasets for video
      summarization.</p> VISIOCITY is a diverse collection of 67 videos spanning across six
      different categories: TV shows (Friends) , sports (Soccer), surveillance, education (Tech-Talks), birthday videos and wedding videos. VISIOCITY
      is compared to existing datasets in Table 2 and Summary statistics
      for VISIOCITY are presented in Table 1.

  <h2 class="page-header">Annotation</h2>
  <h5> Annotation Protocol</h5>
 <p>The annotations are in the form of concepts marked for each shot of a video as against asking annotators to prepare actual summaries. A group of 13 professional annotators were tasked to annotate videos (without listening to the audio) by marking all applicable keywords on a shot through a GUI tool developed by us for this task
   as shown in Figure 1.The tool makes the annotation process easy and reduces chances of errors.Special caution was exercised to ensure high quality annotations
   . Specifically, the guidelines and protocols were made as objective as possible, the annotators were trained through sample annotation tasks, and the annotation
    round was followed by two verification rounds where both precision (how accurate the annotations were) and recall (whether all events of interest and continuity information 
    has been captured in the annotations) were verified by another set of annotators. Whatever inconsistencies or inaccuracies were found and could be 
   automatically detected, were included in our automatic sanity checks which were run on all annotations.
